            <li>
                <a href='api'>JavaScript API Reference</a>
                <p>This is the reference documentation for Multigraph's JavaScript objects, generated automaticaly from the source code using <a href='http://yui.github.com/yuidoc'>YUIDoc</a>. At the moment it is somewhat incomplete and is intended mostly for internal use by Multigraph developers, but the idea is that ultimately these docs will be fleshed out and will become useful as a reference for building applications that use and interact with Multigraph.</p>

            <p>Note that Multigraph uses the <a href='http://github.com/semmypurewal/jermaine'>Jermaine</a> JavaScript modeling tool to define most of its objects; the Multigraph JavaScript API Reference documentation will make a lot more sense if you first have some familiarity with Jermaine.</p>

                <a href='release.html'>Creating a Release</a>
